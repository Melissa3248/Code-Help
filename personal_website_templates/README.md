Personal Website Templates 
======

To create a personal website on Github, feel free to use this [post](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/). It has a lot of text, but it's useful if you've never created your website. It uses this [template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). There are probably many other templates available on Github, but this post should  help with any of them.
