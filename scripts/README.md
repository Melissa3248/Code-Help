# Useful General Purpose Scripts

__submit_parallel_batch_jobs__: contains two python scripts: submit_parallel_batch_jobs.py contains code to submit a large number of sbatch jobs for different input parameters. In this example script, it runs the file my_python_script for various parameter inputs. my_python_script.py parses the input arguments given by the submit_parallel_batch_jobs.py file, and performs some computations based on a given set of input parameters. Both scripts require editing in order to be used for your purposes.
